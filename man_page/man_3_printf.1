.TH _PRINTF 3 "November 2024" "Version 1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
_printf \- format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function produces output according to a
.IR format
string. It writes the output to stdout, the standard output stream.
.PP
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.PP
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
.TP
.B c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\\0').
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B u
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal notation.
.TP
.B o
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal notation.
.TP
.B x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned hexadecimal notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.
.TP
.B p
The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH NOTES
This function does not handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers.
.SH EXAMPLES
To print a string and a character:
.PP
.nf
.RS
_printf("String: %s, Character: %c\\n", "Hello", 'A');
.RE
.fi
.PP
To print integers in various formats:
.PP
.nf
.RS
_printf("Decimal: %d, Hexadecimal: %x\\n", 123, 123);
.RE
.fi
.SH BUGS
